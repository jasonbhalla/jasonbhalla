# Hi, I’m <span style="color:#006876">Jason Bhalla</span>!
### [jasonbhalla.com](https://jasonbhalla.com)

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm a Junior at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, and graduate certificates in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Data Science / Engineering. I'm currently working on interesting research projects and developing some fun projects of my own! I also have the pleasure of being part of an amazing Software Engineering team at Advantest!

I am actively working on open-sourcing my (previously private) projects, so expect my profile to have more soon!

Thanks!
