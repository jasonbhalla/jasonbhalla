Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm a Junior at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics, and a graduate certificate in Machine Learning. I'm currently researching transformer-boosted local-search algorithms for constructions in group theory, and algorithms to iteratively generate incidence structures. I also have the pleasure of being part of an amazing Software Engineering team at Advantest!
